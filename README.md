## 📢 Introduction

Welcome to **Libslm C64** — a chaotic collection of experiments, half-baked ideas, and bursts of inspiration. This isn't a polished, production-ready framework. It's a playground for concepts that may or may not evolve into something meaningful.

Because of its experimental nature, **stability is not guaranteed**. Features may change, disappear, or break without warning. If you're looking for a dependable tool, you might want to look elsewhere. But if you're here out of **curiosity, exploration, or sheer madness** — welcome aboard.

> ⚠️ Use at your own risk. Enjoy the ride.

## 🧠 Virtual Machine (VM)

This project is an experimental virtual machine (VM) written in TypeScript. It aims to simulate a **Commodore 64** and serve as a playground for VM architecture concepts.

### ✨ Features

- More will be coming.

### 🧩 Components

- More will be coming.

### 💡 Usage Example

```typescript
// Missing functionality still, so more will come then.
```

### 🛣️ Roadmap

| Status | Feature |
|:------:|:--------|
| 🔲 | Basic implementation |
| 🔲 | Memory Management |
| 🔲 | IO handling |
| 🔲 | Basic graphic |
| 🔲 | Debugging tools |

### 📝 Notes

This VM is **purely experimental** and not optimized for production. Given the library's experimental status, expect things to **evolve** — or get scrapped entirely.
